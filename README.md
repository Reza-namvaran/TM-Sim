# Turing Machine Simulator

A web-based Turing machine simulator supporting **1, 2, and 3-tape machines** with various computational examples. Built with Python/Flask for educational demonstrations of Turing machine capabilities.

## Features
- **Multi-Tape Support**: Simulate machines with 1, 2, or 3 tapes
- **Sample Library**: Pre-configured examples for different tape configurations:
  - **1-Tape**: Palindrome check, Binary increment
  - **2-Tape**: Binary addition, String comparison
  - **3-Tape**: Binary multiplication, Sorting
- **Visual Debugger**: Step-through execution with tape visualization
- **YAML Configuration**: Easy sample creation/modification
